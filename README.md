# Java OOP Projects

This repository contains several Java projects demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and real-world problem solving. The projects range from simple exercises to practical case studies, showcasing encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in Java.

## Projects

### 1. FizzBuzz (OOP Version)
A classic FizzBuzz exercise implemented using **OOP principles**.  
- Demonstrates the use of **classes and methods** to encapsulate logic.
- Good for practicing basic OOP design and Java syntax.

### 2. ABC Bakery
A **real-world case study** simulating bakery operations.  
- Covers **inventory management, sales calculation, and reporting**.
- Implements OOP concepts for managing bakery products, orders, and customer interactions.

### 3. Hotel Reservation System
A **simple console-based application** for managing hotel bookings and payments.  
- Features **room booking, payment calculation, and receipt generation**.
- Demonstrates **practical OOP design** using multiple classes and methods.

## Features

- Pure Java (no external frameworks)
- Focused on **clean OOP design**
- Each project is self-contained and runnable from the console

## Usage
